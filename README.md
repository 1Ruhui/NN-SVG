NN-SVG
======

What's conventionally described as the trellis structure of the connections between two
fully-connected layers of a neural network is really a visual description of a matrix-vector product.
Driven by the belief that mathematics are beautiful when properly represented,
I'm building a little tool to quickly generate SVG representations of these trellises,
to visualize classic fully-connected neural networks, on top of d3.


In the future I'd like to have three layouts:
- Conventional FCNN layout
- LeNet CNN layout
- AlexNet layout (via webGL)


<!-- TODO
	- assigning new random weights button
	- download svg should eventually work. -->

<!-- maybe add direction the NN should point -->
<!-- maybe add arrows pointing into input, out of output -->
<!-- arrowheads?  -->
<!-- color each layer separately? -->
<!-- click and hold on a node and hide everyting else.  -->
<!-- add bias units option -->
