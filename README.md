NN-SVG
======

What's conventionally described as the trellis structure of the connections between two fully connected layers of a neural network is really a visual description of a matrix-vector product. Driven by the belief that mathematics are beautiful when properly represented, I'm building a library to build SVG representations of these trellises.
