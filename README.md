NN-SVG
======

What's conventionally described as the trellis structure of the connections between two fully connected layers of a neural network is really a visual description of a matrix-vector product. Driven by the belief that mathematics are beautiful when properly represented, I'm building a library to build SVG representations of these trellises, to visualize a classic neural network, on top of sigma.js.


Three layouts:
- Conventional FCNN layout
- LeNet CNN layout
- AlexNet layout with webGL


<!-- TODO
	- assigning new random weights button
	- download svg should eventually work. -->

<!-- maybe add direction the NN should point -->
<!-- maybe add arrows pointing into input, out of output -->
<!-- arrowheads?  -->
<!-- color each layer separately? -->
<!-- click and hold on a node and hide everyting else.  -->
<!-- add bias units option -->
