### this was an older idea which led to this one:

# somehow bind Snap to the canvas

# draw circles in 4 rows on the canvas. (6/row?)

# connect each circle from each row to each circle in the next row

# animate the location of each circle such that it moves to a random location on the canvas,
# but does not occlude any other circle on the canvas

# move them into a shape such that they form a square.

# randomly add and substract edges, using a slider?

######

# generate a square of nodes

# conect them randomly

# use physics simulation to make them find their optimal arrangement.

######

# generate a visualization of a liquid state machine.
